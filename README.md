A Roguelike

1. Attempt taking out StackPane and composing each Tile object with its own Stack.
2. Find way to add background and text to GridPane cells without StackPane.
3. Each movement will pop off current Tile stack and push onto next cell's Tile stack.
4. Keep important Tiles in a data structure for retrieval since GridPane is O(n) lookup due to storing tiles in linear list.
